CONSTANTS & VARIABLES

var myVariable = 5
myVariable = 4
let myConstant = 5

-type inference
-cannot change type
-if initial declaration doesn't provide enough info to specify type:

let implicitInteger = 70
let implicitDouble = 70.0
let explicitDouble: Double = 70

-to change variable type:

let label = "The width is "
let width = 94
let widthLabel = label + String(width)
 
String(integer variable) converts to integer

-string interpolation:

let apples = 3
let oranges = 5
let appleSummary = "I have \(apples) apples."
let fruitSummary = "I have \(apples + oranges) pieces of fruit."
