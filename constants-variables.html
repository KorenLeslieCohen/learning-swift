## CONSTANTS & VARIABLES

var myVariable = 5
myVariable = 4
let myConstant = 5

-type inference
-cannot change type
-if initial declaration doesn't provide enough info to specify type:

let implicitInteger = 70
let implicitDouble = 70.0
let explicitDouble: Double = 70

-to change variable type:

let label = "The width is "
let width = 94
let widthLabel = label + String(width)
 
String(integer variable) converts to integer

-string interpolation:

let apples = 3
let oranges = 5
let appleSummary = "I have \(apples) apples."
let fruitSummary = "I have \(apples + oranges) pieces of fruit."

## OPTIONALS

-optionals address missing values:

let optionalInt: Int? = 9

-unwrap variables with force unwrap operator (!)
-to get the underlying type from an optional
-only use if you're sure underlying value isn't nil

let actualInt: Int = optionalInt!

-optionals and attempted type conversion:

var myString = "7"
var possibleInt = Int(myString)
print(possibleInt)

-if myString can't be converted into integer:

myString = "banana"
possibleInt = Int(myString) ---> nil
print(possibleInt)

-implicitly unwrapped optional
-can be used like nonoptional value, without need to unwrap the optional value each time
-assumed to always have a value after value initially set (though) value can change)

var implicitlyUnwrappedOptionalInt: Int!

## ARRAYS

var ratingList = ["Poor", "Fine", "Good", "Excellent"]
ratingList[1] = "OK"
ratingList

-initialize empty array using initializer:

let emptyArray = [String]()
